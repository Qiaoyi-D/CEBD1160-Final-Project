## Research Question

Based on the factors that relavent to cardiovascular diseasesï¼ŒCan we perdict what kind of people would most likely have the diseases?
 
### Abstract

Derived from the historical cardiovascular diseases database, we could have the information about the factors that related with the cardio diseases. By using theses data, we could understand that the level of impact for each of these facters could have to cause the cardio diseases. We will try to predict if the people will get the cardio diseases or not by analysis the connectivity among factors and cardio diseases. The model shows that age,gender and weight have more impact than other facters, and we could predic the diseases by that but we also need further analysis.

### Introduction

The number of cardiovascular diseases has increased in recent years, and it has become one of the important topics for medical research. The data set includes 70,000 patient data records with 12 characteristics such as age, gender, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure. When the patient has cardiovascular disease, the target class "cardio" is equal to 1, and if the patient is healthy, it is 0.

### Methods

Brief (no more than 1-2 paragraph) description about how you decided to approach solving it. Include:

- pseudocode for this method (either created by you or cited from somewhere else)
- why you chose this method

### Results

Brief (2 paragraph) description about your results. Include:

- At least 1 figure
- At least 1 "value" that summarizes either your data or the "performance" of your method
- A short explanation of both of the above

### Discussion
Brief (no more than 1-2 paragraph) description about what you did. Include:

- interpretation of whether your method "solved" the problem
- suggested next step that could make it better.
