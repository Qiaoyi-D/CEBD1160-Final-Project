## Research Question

Based on the factors that relavent to cardiovascular diseasesï¼ŒCan we perdict what kind of people would most likely have the diseases?
 
### Abstract
Derived from the historical cardiovascular diseases database, we could have the information about the factors that related with the cardio diseases. By using theses data, we could understand that the level of impact for each of these facters could have to cause the cardio diseases. We will try to predict if the people will get the cardio diseases or not by analysis the connectivity among factors and cardio diseases.
- resolution (what did we end up producing)

### Introduction

Brief (no more than 1-2 paragraph) description about the dataset. Can copy from elsewhere, but cite the source (i.e. at least link, and explicitly say if it's copied from elsewhere).

### Methods

Brief (no more than 1-2 paragraph) description about how you decided to approach solving it. Include:

- pseudocode for this method (either created by you or cited from somewhere else)
- why you chose this method

### Results

Brief (2 paragraph) description about your results. Include:

- At least 1 figure
- At least 1 "value" that summarizes either your data or the "performance" of your method
- A short explanation of both of the above

### Discussion
Brief (no more than 1-2 paragraph) description about what you did. Include:

- interpretation of whether your method "solved" the problem
- suggested next step that could make it better.
